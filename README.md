**DESCRIPTION**

## About App
*Our application  breatharmony consists of a regular meditation  routine program along with yoga which will be introduced to the user in the upcoming phases. 
*To enhance gamification, with every growing phase a tree will be growing to indicate user's progress and if meditation is discontinued for a longer duration  then the tree  will be going back to it's initial state. Thus, the growing tree helps in user's habit building.  
*Yoga that is introduced in the futher stages aslo has a guide with pictures for better understanding of correct yoga postures.
